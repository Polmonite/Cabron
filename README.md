# Cabrón

Cabrón!

My version of Tron Light Cycle.

In Table.

## How to run

If you are one of those asshats that love docker, you can do a:

`docker-compose up`

Or you can start it up directly with node (after an `npm install`):

`node server.js`

Then go to `localhost:4567`; give your IP to some friends in your network and play together.

Under `localhost:4567/monitor` a monitoring of current rooms, players and AI players. 

## How to play

Create or join a room, simply by inserting the room name.
If you don't have enough friends, you can play against the "very intelligent" AI.

Once started, simply use the arrows to move; use the space-bar to use turbo.
